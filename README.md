titanic
=======

Using the titanic dataset from Kaggle, I play around with the dataset by cleaning, manipulating, and exploring.

For most variables, I create a functions that manipulate the given dataset (train or test). For example, for the Name variable,
I create a function to grab the Title of each name ("Mr", "Jonkheer", "Master", etc).
